# TinyGeo
*A light-weight C++ library for Geometry.*

### Basic Geometric Type
*For simplicity, we abstract the geometric shapes into three types: `Point`, `Line` and `Polygon`. There are derived class of abstract class `Geometry`. Some libraries define other types of geometry such as multi-point, multi-line or multi-polygon, etc. These types will be represented as a collection of primitive types in TinyGeo.*
- **Point**
- **Line**
- **Polygon**
